# Browser Control Plan

## Standalone installation validation

Debugger inventory must prove this extension owns each attachment with a
read-only command; Chrome's global `attached` flag also includes DevTools.
`page.title()` has a five-second read deadline because Playwright exposes no
timeout for that method. This bounds the observed missing-context title hang;
it is not a general cancellation mechanism for arbitrary user scripts.

Runtime candidates constrain npm's Effect and shared Node adapter resolution to
the checkout's pinned releases. Otherwise npm can install a newer prerelease peer
beside the CLI's pinned Effect, causing missing services or missing module exports.
Candidate CLI, SDK and MCP checks run before selecting the installation.

September 14 field check: customized a restaurant item, verified its cart snapshot,
removed it, and restarted/reconnected to the same browser tab successfully. Compact
labels now include visible image alt text. Full accessible-name equivalence is not
guaranteed; agents should use snapshot refs and refresh after virtualized DOM changes.

Browser Control is a local driver that lets trusted agents automate the user's
already-running Chromium-family browser. It provides browser control, session
isolation, and diagnostics; it does not call models or decide what to do.

```text
Agent / MCP client / CLI
  -> relay-backed execute session
  -> local relay
  -> browser extension
  -> user's Chromium-family browser tabs
```

The end-to-end path is working. Current work should simplify the relay and make
recording robust. New features
should not weaken the code-first interface or move behavior into the extension
without a concrete browser-API reason.

## Next Priorities

Work these in order unless field evidence changes the priority. Every item
should land with unit or smoke evidence appropriate to the behavior.

September 6 fieldwork: resubmitted the existing Chrome Web Store item with shim
0.0.24 and a real handoff demonstration replacing the old Example Domain media.
The dashboard confirmed Pending Review, with Unlisted visibility. Await approval
before advertising Store availability. Keep the independently versioned shim;
snapshot corrections ship in the local driver, not the Store ZIP.
See `docs/CHROME_WEB_STORE.md` for the prepared artifact.

### 1. Verify isolated runtime upgrades

Candidate preparation builds, packs, installs, and validates outside the live
checkout. Installation selection changes one shared pointer for future CLI/MCP
processes, not an existing daemon. Keep old complete installations until their
processes retire. The loaded extension directory is separate from this workflow.

Preparation also checks the packed Effect dependency cohort in a fresh isolated
pnpm consumer, without checkout locks or user overrides. Keep all three Effect
runtime packages exactly aligned; this is not a universal host-graph lock.

Ordinary clients may start an absent daemon but never replace a running one.
`browser-control relay restart` is the sole CLI replacement operation. It requires
an exact managed instance with safe shutdown protocol 2, records bounded private
attribution, drains accepted work, and refuses raw clients or active recordings.
Failed or cancelled pre-commit drains reopen admission without a delayed stop.

Verification:

- Validate final installed artifacts, not only source imports or an earlier build.
- Exercise old/new installed clients, explicit replacement, inventory restoration,
  and forbidden tab-close commands on isolated ports with a fake extension.
- Real physical-tab continuity still needs an explicitly authorized isolated
  browser check. Another browser profile alone shares the extension's fixed port.

### 2. Concentrate relay lifecycle invariants

Extract cohesive modules from `makeRelay` without changing the protocol:

- Deepen `CdpRouter` with command classification, guardrails, and compatibility
  shims.
- Keep root-generation preparation, verification, replacement, and bounded
  reconciliation together. Extracting event decoding alone does not remove
  ordering obligations.

`CdpClientPool` owns client sockets, private per-client announcements and aliases,
auto-attach settings, and connection generations. Attachment deduplication,
descendant-first detach, and alias invalidation are complete transitions behind
its interface, tested through an event sink without browser or websocket mocks.
`CdpRouter` owns
client-relative visibility, target inventory, target and alias resolution, and
exact root-versus-child Chrome session routing.
Named browser-context commands skip crashed owned roots without falling back to
unrelated tabs. Raw-client ambiguity includes crashed roots; visibility and
explicit target routing do not filter them out.

`CdpRuntime` owns register-before-send context observation, bounded reset fallback,
and idle reset targeting. Runtime recovery is tied to captured root/child and
extension generations plus current client visibility, never just a physical tab
id. HTTP and MCP retain validated target selections instead of flattening and
reparsing them at successive layers.

The goal is browser-free testing of routing and lifecycle behavior, not smaller
files for their own sake. Keep composition and resource lifetime in `makeRelay`,
but put ordering-sensitive transitions in their owning modules. Avoid exposing
internal protocol details to the CLI or MCP server.

Use Knip and TypeScript unused-local checks as CI gates for internal cleanup.
Keep public SDK and dynamically loaded entry points explicit. Duplicate-code
scans are advisory; consolidate identical rules without removing features or
combining operations with different lifetime guarantees.

`BrowserControlSessions` installs the sandbox's default-target callback itself.
The callback is bound to the exact session instance, so late notifications from
a retired sandbox cannot overwrite a reset or recreated session's catalog entry.
The sandbox exposes only settled teardown; caller deadlines remain in the
manager's tracked cleanup workers. Handoff readiness follows the selected page,
with exact-target reacquisition retained for default-page replacement.

`RootTargetLifecycle` owns per-tab preparation, staging, verification, commit,
scoped reconciliation workers, and generation checks across asynchronous steps.
Committed ownership and handoff/default-target rebinding precede retiring old
client views; stale workers cannot tear down a successor generation.
Committed and staged root probes retain exhausted RPC errors or reject malformed
target info. A failed inventory readiness check closes the extension socket with
1011 and clears live registry state through disconnect cleanup; this is not
automatic debugger reattachment or full SPA recovery.

Verification:

- Extend reconnect, OOPIF, and multi-client smoke cases to cover root detach and
  conflicting client auto-attach settings.
- Preserve complete staged child subtrees through replacement, including nested
  descendants and mixed insertion order, and reject stale-generation completion.

### 3. Validate new agent surfaces in the real browser

- Exercise snapshot search, automatic deltas, stable same-document refs,
  contenteditable filling, WebMCP discovery/calls, and human demonstration code
  generation against local fixtures and an adopted user tab.
- Exercise MCP recording lifecycle parity and repeated flight-recorder
  `save-last` clips without stopping the rolling buffer.

Verification:

- Confirm CLI and MCP recording behavior match and inspect encoded flight clips.

## Recently Shipped

### Agent inspection and page-native tools are more reusable

`snapshot({ find, context })` returns bounded semantic snippets, while
`snapshot({ delta: true })` establishes a baseline automatically and emits later
changes. Compatible structural/accessibility identities retain ref ids across
same-document captures; navigation still invalidates every ref. WebMCP-enabled
pages are available through frame-aware `webmcp.list()` and `webmcp.call()`
execute helpers that re-discover registrations before invoking them.

### Human demonstrations become editable Playwright

`demonstrate()` layers action recording onto the exact-tab handoff lifecycle.
It records user clicks, edits, checkbox/select changes, and navigations, compacts
successive text edits, and returns structured steps plus executable Playwright.
Password values become explicit secret-source placeholders.

### Recording covers MCP and recent-history capture

MCP exposes ordinary recording start/stop/status/cancel operations. The rolling
flight recorder keeps a bounded recent CDP compositor-frame window in memory,
reports retention and drop counters, and can encode repeated WebM/MP4 `save-last`
clips without stopping. It writes a sidecar receipt and cannot share a tab with
an ordinary recording.

### Windows tolerates unsupported directory sync

Session catalog replacement and lifecycle logging retain file-level sync and
attempt directory sync everywhere, but tolerate only platform/filesystem errors
that explicitly mean directory handles cannot be synced.

### Fill helpers support rich-text editors

`fillInput` and `fillInputs` update contenteditable elements as well as input and
textarea controls while preserving the existing no-focus DOM fallback behavior.

### Session cleanup is safely repeatable

Deleting a resolved session id is idempotent across HTTP, CLI, and MCP. The
structured result reports whether a live session was deleted, while CLI cleanup
retries no longer turn an already-absent session into a failure.

### Handoffs return on a live destination context

After a human completes a navigation-triggering handoff, Browser Control waits
through transient execution-context replacement before returning to user code.
The same execute can immediately inspect and verify the authenticated
destination without repeating the human action.

### Browser restarts wake extension reconnection

The extension registers a global `runtime.onStartup` listener so restarting the
browser profile wakes its MV3 worker, repairs the reconnect alarm, and opens a
fresh relay socket. The existing 20-second heartbeat keeps that socket active
after reconnection.

When the relay is down, Chrome stops the idle worker and only the 30-second
reconnect alarm wakes it. Relay clients therefore wait one alarm period plus a
5-second margin for the extension after relay startup. Both values derive from
`extensionReconnectAlarmPeriodMs` in `src/protocol.ts`, and the CLI prints one
line when that wait begins.

### Unpacked extension connectivity survives browser and path differences

The unpacked manifest carries a stable public key, while Store packaging strips
it before creating the review ZIP. Extension readiness waits only for debugger
inventory: Arc tab-group queries and restored-tab presentation run afterward,
cannot mutate from stale sockets, serialize ownership changes per tab, and
report failures through relay diagnostics.

### Public clients tolerate extension reconnect windows

`BrowserControlClient.make` gives a matching pre-existing relay the same bounded
extension reconnect grace used after relay startup. Session summaries report
connected only when the Playwright transport and a live default page are both
available.

### Tab-capture recordings stream with intrinsic framing

Extension protocol `2` sends each recording chunk as a sequenced `BCRD` binary
frame containing its tab id. The relay validates framing and sequence, bounds
pending writes, streams each tab to an adjacent temporary file, and atomically
renames complete recordings. Interleaving, oversized queues, malformed frames,
and output larger than a single frame have direct coverage.

### Fill helpers traverse open shadow roots

String selectors passed to `fillInput` and `fillInputs` now search recursively
through open shadow roots. A zero-match error explains that closed roots remain
unavailable and suggests `locator.fill()` when Playwright can resolve the field.

### Session lifecycle selectors are consistent

`session reset` and `session delete` accept positional ids, `--session`/`-s`,
and `BROWSER_CONTROL_SESSION` before falling back to the saved current session.
Smoke coverage verifies explicit missing flag and environment ids fail instead
of falling back to the saved current session.

### CDP routing fails closed

Identity-free `Target.getTargetInfo` no longer returns an arbitrary tab, and
otherwise-unhandled sessionless CDP commands require an explicit session. All
explicit target and session routing now rechecks client visibility, including
session-scoped auto-attach. Root teardown emits each announced child detach
before detaching the root so clients cannot retain orphaned sessions. The
browser-free `CdpRouter` module keeps these visibility, alias, and generation
rules out of relay transport orchestration. Browser-context permission and
cookie commands route through a session-owned root for named clients, including
multi-page sessions and browser CDP aliases, or exactly one visible root for raw
clients, without falling through from a named client to an unrelated tab.
Explicit browser-context ids must match a healthy visible root. Raw clients may
route through several visible roots only when every root proves the same
Chromium context; crashed roots never satisfy context routing.

### CDP client state is isolated per connection

`CdpClientPool` now owns each CDP client's session identity, target
announcements, aliases, auto-attach settings, and idle-reset generation. New
targets use the originating client's auto-attach settings instead of global
last-writer-wins state. Ownership visibility changes also invalidate target
aliases, so a client cannot continue routing commands to a tab after it becomes
hidden.

### Wedged session pages recover or fail fast

A 2026-07-09 field failure left a relay-owned page open but unusable after its
execution context was destroyed. Later calls each consumed their full timeout,
and the target remained at `chrome-error://chromewebdata/`.

Browser Control now remembers context failures and browser crash events. Before
the next normal execute, it gives the default page a bounded health check.
Only a disposable relay-owned page (crashed renderer, `about:blank`, or a
`chrome-error://` document) is closed and recreated with a stale-reference
warning; if it cannot be closed, execute fails with reset guidance instead of
leaking ownership. Any other live page is kept. An unhealthy adopted user tab
is never closed or replaced; the execute fails quickly and tells the agent to
reset or adopt another tab.

A 2026-09-19 field failure showed why a relay-owned page must not be treated as
disposable: a page whose execution context went stale after a sign-in redirect
(and one stalled by a bot-protected form) was closed and replaced with
`about:blank`, discarding the login and form state the user had just produced.
Playwright's stale context is a symptom of its view of the tab, not proof the
tab is gone. Browser Control now drops its Playwright connection, reconnects,
and re-resolves the same target once; the relay's `Runtime.enable` replay
recovery then runs on the fresh connection. If the page still does not answer,
execute fails with a `session-page/owned-unresponsive` diagnosis that names the
kept tab and the likely causes (mid-navigation, bot protection stalling the main
world for automation). A resolved handoff whose destination context never
appears reports the same distinction instead of a bare Playwright error.

`Inspector.targetCrashed` and `Target.targetCrashed` events mark the target,
reject its pending debugger commands without disconnecting the extension, and
appear as `crashed=true` in status and doctor data. `chrome-error://` targets are
also unhealthy. Cross-extension navigation failures receive the bounded
`target/cross-extension-page` diagnostic.

The `execute-page-recovery` smoke crashes a relay-owned renderer, asserts prompt
failure and status visibility, then verifies that the next execute receives a
fresh page. Unit coverage verifies that adopted pages are preserved.

### Extension child targets stay subordinate

Unknown `Target.targetInfoChanged` events no longer overwrite a tab's root
target. URL-less child pages are held until their destination is known, and a
child that resolves to another extension is removed without changing the
session-owned page. This prevents password-manager UI from becoming the
session default or producing cross-extension navigation failures.

### Downloads fail with an explicit capability boundary

Chromium rejects both `Browser.setDownloadBehavior` and the legacy
`Page.setDownloadBehavior` through a tab-scoped `chrome.debugger` attachment.
Without either command, stock Playwright cannot retain the GUID-named artifact
that backs `download.saveAs()`. Browser Control therefore rejects
`page.waitForEvent("download")` immediately with the reason and a fetch-plus-`fs`
workaround rather than allowing a 30-second timeout. A local blob/fetch fixture
keeps this failure direct. Supporting native download artifacts later would
require a new extension capture protocol and permission model.

## Product Boundaries

- **Driver, not agent**: Browser Control never calls models or plans tasks.
- **User browser first**: the primary target is an already-running
  Chromium-family browser with the extension installed.
- **Trusted local execution**: `execute(code)` trusts the calling agent. It is
  not an untrusted-code security boundary.
- **Code-first control**: `execute(code)` is the primary interface. Dedicated
  tools exist only for lifecycle operations that benefit from explicit command
  semantics.
- **Playwright first**: v1 uses stock `playwright-core`. Custom behavior should
  not require a Playwright fork.
- **Local by default**: the relay binds to trusted local interfaces. Remote
  access requires an explicit authentication design before it is added.
- **Stable extension shim**: Chrome API adaptation belongs in the extension;
  orchestration belongs in the relay so most changes require only a relay
  restart.
- **Minimal extension UI**: the toolbar controls attachment, while subtle
  in-page UI communicates attached, running, and waiting states. There is no
  side panel.
- **Concise self-description**: `browser-control skill` prints one short,
  current workflow document. Do not split it into topic subcommands or require
  agents to perform a reading ceremony.

## Distribution And Installation

- The product, repository, CLI, and MCP server use the name `browser-control`.
  The npm package is `@opencode-ai/browser-control`.
- The package is published publicly on npm. Normal setup installs the npm
  artifact. Development uses isolated `runtime:prepare` / `runtime:select`
  installations rather than linking a mutable checkout into the live CLI/MCP.
  Candidate builds never overwrite the loaded unpacked extension directory.
- The CLI, MCP server, and source toolchain require Node.js 22.19 or newer,
  matching the minimum runtime supported by the pinned Effect Platform stack.
- Until the first Store review completes, the browser extension is loaded
  unpacked from the npm package's `extension/dist` directory or a source build.
  Its current shim version is `0.0.24`. A manifest public key gives unpacked
  builds one stable extension id across install paths and operating systems;
  Store packaging strips that key so the Store keeps its assigned id.
- Extension and npm releases are independently versioned. The extension hello
  reports an explicit protocol version, and compatibility rather than exact
  package-version equality determines whether the local driver may use it.
- Browser data crosses only the loopback connection unless an authorized local
  caller sends returned data elsewhere.
- Extension source changes require rebuilding and reloading the unpacked
  extension. Relay-only changes do not.
- `pnpm package:extension` produces the deterministic Chrome Web Store review
  ZIP. Distribution starts as an unlisted beta before becoming public. A bundled
  unpacked extension belongs to future managed-browser launch flows.

## Session And Tab Model

A relay serves one browser/profile connection at a time. The first compatible
OPEN connection keeps ownership through inventory reconciliation and normal
operation; another connection is rejected with close code 4004 instead of
destroying existing targets, handoffs, or pending commands. Contention starts a
bounded websocket liveness probe so a dead incumbent cannot hold ownership
indefinitely. Genuine disconnect/reconnect still rebuilds the inventory.
`status` and `doctor` report rejected connection attempts, not a browser count.
This does not add simultaneous multi-browser routing or persistent browser
selection: switching requires disconnecting the incumbent extension.

Password-manager extension UI is a Chromium permission boundary, not a missing
page. A cross-extension failure keeps the session's page and returns an explicit
human-action warning rather than scheduling automatic page replacement.
Protected extension iframes/popups and native unlock/Touch ID prompts are not
supported control surfaces; no browser security flags or vault access are added.

Focusing a card or credential field is enough to trigger that boundary: the
password manager injects a `chrome-extension://` inline-menu iframe into the
webpage. Chrome reports it to the root session as an ordinary child frame, so
stock Playwright kept an empty-URL phantom frame under the main frame, and from
then on `chrome.debugger` rejected every command for the tab with "Cannot access
a chrome-extension:// URL of different extension". Playwright rewrites that into
"Execution context was destroyed" and retries locators to their 30 s timeout,
which used to look like an unresponsive page and trigger the health check and
repair path. The relay now tracks such protected frames per tab: it retracts the
forwarded attach with a synthetic `Page.frameDetached`, suppresses the frame's
later events, records the debugger block as `protectedUi` on the root target
(visible in `status` and `doctor`), and lifts it when a command succeeds again
or the last protected frame is removed. The sandbox turns masked
destroyed-context and locator-timeout failures on a blocked tab into the
`target/cross-extension-page` diagnostic with the human-action warning and skips
the page health check, so the tab is never repaired or replaced for a prompt the
user simply has to dismiss.

An attached tab is a browser target exposed by the extension. An unowned
attached tab remains visible to connected clients for explicit recovery and raw
CDP workflows. A Browser Control session owns one default page and persistent
JavaScript `state`; normal execute calls use that page instead of choosing an
arbitrary tab from the attached pool.

- Bare CLI execute atomically creates a fresh readable session and prints its
  id.
- `--session` or `BROWSER_CONTROL_SESSION` explicitly continues a CLI session.
- One MCP server process owns one implicit execute session. Explicit MCP session
  management remains available for lifecycle operations.
- The CLI never infers an agent's session from human-shell current state.
- Human session-management commands store their endpoint-scoped current id in
  `~/.browser-control/session.json`.
- The relay stores private session descriptors under
  `~/.browser-control/relays/<port>/sessions.json`. Relay restart restores ids,
  read-only mode, and exact target ownership when the tab reappears; JavaScript
  `state` and snapshot refs reset with an explicit warning.
- A session owns one default page. Relay-created pages persist across
  short-lived CLI connections.
- `session adopt` makes an attached user tab the session's default page and
  closes the session's previous relay-created page.
- Adoption is exclusive: one target can belong to only one Browser Control
  session. `TargetRegistry` is the ownership authority; session state retains
  only the adopted default-page pointer.
- Adoption reserves target ownership before Playwright resolves the page, then
  commits or rolls back as one serialized transaction. A caller timeout rolls
  back visibility immediately while the worker retains the execute and adopt
  permits until any uncancellable Playwright work settles.
- Reset, delete, or detach releases an adopted tab without closing it.
- Reset and delete acquire the execute permit before closing a sandbox, so they
  cannot interrupt a running script.
- Reset and delete give an absent persisted relay target a bounded opportunity
  to re-announce. A completed protocol-v1 inventory, or expiry of the reconnect
  grace, declares that identity dead so recovery cannot require catalog edits.
  The relay never guesses a physical tab to close when the live target identity
  is unavailable.
- Corrupt session catalogs fail relay startup without being overwritten.
- The relay wins the endpoint port before loading the catalog or enabling
  catalog writes. Lifecycle responses wait for atomic file replacement, file
  sync, and directory sync before acknowledging durable state.
- Session-owned tabs share a purple `control` group within each browser window.
  Merely attached, unowned tabs stay in their existing location.
- Explicit URL selection must match exactly one page. URL and index selectors
  cannot be combined.

CDP target visibility is scoped per client. Session-owned tabs and their events
are visible only to that session's clients; unowned tabs are visible to all
clients. This prevents concurrent Playwright clients from double-initializing a
page while retaining explicit attached-tab recovery. Every ownership change
reconciles existing client announcements, browser grouping, and page status.

## Current Capabilities

### Execute

- Navigate, inspect, click, fill, wait, evaluate, and capture screenshots with
  stock Playwright APIs.
- Create tabs through `context.newPage()` and preserve session `state` across
  execute calls.
- Run inline code or `--file <path>` scripts, with conservative auto-return for
  single expressions such as `page.url()`.
- Expose selected Node built-ins: `fs`, `path`, `os`, `crypto`, `url`, `util`,
  `events`, `stream`, `buffer`, `http`, `https`, and `zlib`. `child_process` is
  not exposed by default.
- Return structured values, script and page logs, page errors, warnings,
  diagnostics, session identity, and per-call aftermath.
- Health-check a default page after execution-context failure or a crash event.
  Recreate unhealthy relay-owned pages and preserve unhealthy adopted tabs.
- Transfer returned PNG, JPEG, and WebP buffers through a dedicated media
  channel. MCP emits native image attachments without temporary files or
  duplicated base64 metadata.

### Authenticated Network Capture

- Each Execute Sandbox owns one normalized network recorder that follows its
  default or adopted page across execute calls and page recovery.
- Playwright page events capture root-frame and child-frame exchanges. HAR is
  an export adapter, not the recorder's domain model.
- Request and response bodies have per-body and aggregate byte budgets;
  truncation, failures, and dropped-entry counts remain visible in summaries.
- Written artifacts always replace credential-bearing headers, cookies, query
  parameters, and structured body fields with stable `BC_SECRET_N` references.
- Named secret profiles retain lossless values in restrictive local files.
  Cross-process locks serialize profile publication; repeated captures and
  reload-based refresh preserve references by observed request source.
- `secrets run` injects profile values into a child process and redacts known
  values from bounded stdout and stderr before returning them.
- The public `SecretProfile` SDK exposes metadata-only `status` and redacted
  profile-worker `run`, so generated applications do not require a
  user-authored `browser-control secrets run` wrapper or gain raw profile reads.
- While capture is active, values observed in completed exchanges and
  secret-shaped returned data are removed from execute results, URLs, logs,
  and journal records before they leave the sandbox.
- CLI, MCP, and execute-sandbox helpers call the same session-owned recorder.
  Capture is cancelled on session reset, deletion, and relay shutdown.

### Inspection And Interaction Helpers

- `snapshot(options?)` provides a bounded semantic read-before-act view.
  Its default root prefers a single visible modal, includes out-of-main portal
  dialogs, and reserves only a bounded share of the budget for list wrappers.
  Native input roles match Playwright; native disclosure controls use structural
  summary refs instead of an incorrect button-role constraint.
- `snapshot({ diff: true })` compares against the previous compatible snapshot
  while `snapshot({ delta: true })` returns a full first baseline and automatic
  later deltas. `snapshot({ find, context })` returns matching semantic snippets.
- `ref(id)` resolves controls from the latest valid snapshot and fails closed
  after navigation or incompatible DOM drift. Compatible ids survive repeated
  same-document captures.
- `ariaSnapshot()` and raw Playwright provide deeper inspection when compact
  snapshots are insufficient. The helper omits native text-control values,
  custom ARIA range values, and editable content across SVG and open-shadow
  boundaries. Each isolated-world mask is scoped to its activation frame and a
  module-unique token, so concurrent guarded snapshots restore safely without
  depending on unrelated frames. It must be awaited separately from other page
  operations while the mask is active.
- `screenshotWithLabels({ page, path? })` annotates likely interactive elements
  and returns label metadata.
- `screenshotDiff({ baseline, path?, threshold?, fullPage? })` compares PNGs at
  the same CSS-pixel scale and returns changed-pixel counts/ratio plus a
  red-highlighted image. It rejects dimension mismatches instead of resizing,
  counts antialiasing changes, bounds input size, and never overwrites an existing
  output. It is an execute helper, not a new action-tool family.
- `fillInput` and `fillInputs` provide a DOM-evaluation fallback for input,
  textarea, and contenteditable fields when native Playwright filling hangs.
- `webmcp.list()` and `webmcp.call()` discover and invoke frame-scoped page tools.
- Allowed Playwright mouse actions can reveal a spring-animated cursor.
  `showGhostCursor()`, `hideGhostCursor()`, and `ghostCursor.show/hide` provide
  explicit cosmetic control.

### Human Control And Safety

- The extension toolbar attaches or detaches the active tab. A toolbar click
  cannot detach a tab while its session is executing or waiting for a handoff.
- `handoff(message, { timeoutMs, start? })` binds a waiter to the exact page target,
  survives top-level navigation, and resumes only from the matching in-page
  completion control. The relay ignores ambiguous `target_closed` events from
  extension child targets, so the extension preserves the WAIT UI until the
  relay confirms a root detach or the tab is removed.
- `start` registers WAIT state before invoking a prompt-triggering action, so
  native WebAuthn or payment UI cannot block the script before handoff exists.
  It runs only after the extension acknowledges WAIT. Human completion waits
  for the action to settle; timeout or target cancellation disconnects the
  sandbox's Playwright connection before releasing the execute permit, so a
  non-settling action cannot mutate the page later.
- `demonstrate()` uses that same waiter while recording human interactions and
  returns structured actions plus editable Playwright code.
- Destructive browser-state CDP methods such as `Browser.close` and cookie or
  cache clearing are always blocked.
- Read-only sessions additionally reject `Input.*`. They reduce trusted
  mistakes; they do not prevent mutation through `page.evaluate`.
- Safe destructive UI scripts inspect the target first, validate confirmation
  dialog text inside the approved action, and verify the result through an
  independent read path.

### Operations And Diagnostics

- Relay-backed CLI and MCP commands share one detached relay and start it when
  needed. The relay outlives the MCP process, so a CLI handoff is not coupled to
  MCP lifecycle. `status` and `doctor` remain observational; `serve` is the
  foreground debugging path.
- MCP startup, discovery, `skill`, and `session_current` are relay-independent.
  Operational calls ensure readiness on each use; the first pays any cold-start
  cost. Relay-backed observational tools report unavailability without autostart.
- Smoke commands have one attempt and one verdict. Timeouts remain failures;
  explicit repetitions are separate results, not silent recovery retries.
- A running daemon is replaced only by explicit `browser-control relay restart`,
  never by ordinary CLI/MCP/SDK calls. Safe shutdown protocol 2 requires the
  exact managed instance and bounded requester metadata. Legacy, foreground,
  source, and newer relays are never killed speculatively. A legacy relay needs
  a one-time coordinated manual stop before the new runtime starts.
- Admission closes before drain; accepted operations retain their transports and
  permits through real settlement, including late journal promises and retired
  sandbox cleanup. Restart timeouts leave the daemon running. Endpoint-local
  `lifecycle.jsonl` records requested, cancelled, stopping, closed, and successor-ready
  events without browser/account data.
- `doctor` reports relay and extension versions, build mismatches, sessions,
  active targets, child targets, crashed/browser-error targets, and built
  artifacts.
- `browser-control skill` prints the concise, current agent workflow.
- Each execute appends a best-effort bounded entry to
  `~/.browser-control/sessions/<id>/journal.jsonl`.
- Recording supports extension `chrome.tabCapture` WebM for user-owned tabs and
  relay-owned CDP screencasting to WebM or MP4.
- CLI and MCP expose recording lifecycle operations. A separate bounded flight
  recorder can save recent WebM/MP4 clips repeatedly without stopping.

## Architecture Decisions

### The relay owns orchestration

- Node-side code uses Effect v4 (`4.0.0-rc.118`), with matching
  `@effect/platform-node`. The local `effect` checkout is the API and pattern
  reference; the former `effect-smol` repository is archived.
- Effect-returning functions prefer `Effect.fn` or `Effect.fnUntraced`.
- Playwright and relay resources use scoped lifecycles.
- Application configuration uses Effect `Config`; direct environment access is
  limited to synchronous Node process adapters.
- The extension remains plain TypeScript and browser-native.
- The extension protocol remains custom JSON over websocket until schema or
  versioning needs justify Effect RPC. Its shared pure validators reject
  malformed commands and envelopes without pulling Effect into the MV3 shim.
- Authenticated capture stays in the relay-backed session sandbox. The
  extension forwards the CDP traffic Playwright already needs; Node handles
  correlation, budgets, export, credential profiles, and refresh.

### One schema and one client define the relay boundary

- HTTP wire shapes live in `src/relay-schema.ts` as Effect Schemas.
- Responders and clients derive types from those schemas rather than hand-written
  JSON checks.
- CLI and MCP relay access goes through `src/relay-client.ts`; neither maintains
  an ad hoc HTTP client.
- The public Effect client uses the same typed relay client. It atomically
  ensures named sessions and exposes an origin-bound capability for structured
  JSON requests in the live default page.
- Authenticated-origin requests use page-context `window.fetch`, never exported
  cookies or Secret Profiles. They pin an exact origin, accept relative paths,
  block redirects, bound response bytes, and never retry mutations.
- Sensitive authenticated responses bypass execute journals, return as Effect
  `Redacted` values, set `Cache-Control: no-store`, and fail closed while a
  session Network Capture is active.
- The public client reveals sensitive responses through its own `reveal`
  operation so package-manager layouts with multiple Effect instances do not
  cross incompatible module-local Redacted registries.
- Boundary failures use tagged schema errors and a shared coded error envelope.
  The relay retains its message as the top-level human-readable message while
  clients can branch on stable codes for invalid requests, missing resources,
  ownership conflicts, lifecycle conflicts, and internal failures.
- Each HTTP effect is interrupted when its response closes. Execute protects
  the underlying uncancellable Playwright Promise so its session permit remains
  held until browser work actually settles.
- Corrupt current-session persistence fails visibly and remains untouched
  rather than being interpreted as an empty store.

### CDP relay invariants preserve reconnect correctness

- Store a root page target before applying `Target.setAutoAttach`; Chrome can
  emit child or OOPIF attachment events immediately.
- Forward routable dedicated workers to Playwright. Resume and suppress paused
  unsupported children, such as page-scoped service workers, so they cannot
  block parent navigation.
- Replay stored child attachments and current child-frame navigation when an
  OOPIF reconnects.
- Never announce one target id twice to the same client. Emit
  `Target.detachedFromTarget` before re-announcing it with a new session id.
- Treat a new root target/session generation for an existing physical tab as a
  replacement transaction: preserve committed ownership, roll back provisional
  adoption ownership, detach old clients and children, rebind handoffs, and
  reacquire the new Playwright page by exact target id.
- Await HTTP and websocket close callbacks during relay shutdown so tests and
  smoke runs do not leak ports or listeners.
- Relay shutdown closes the adoption gate and drains active or queued adoption
  workers before session resources. It never interrupts a worker whose
  underlying Playwright Promise may still mutate its sandbox.

### A command timeout does not imply a dead extension

A timed-out extension RPC fails only that command. The relay closes the
extension socket only when a websocket ping also fails. This prevents one
dialog-blocked tab from destroying every session's relay state.

### Execute output describes one call

Warnings and aftermath belong to the execute call that caused them. Aftermath
tracks URL movement, main-frame navigation, console and page errors, and
handoffs. The relay does not install a passive `page.on("dialog")` listener
because that would suppress Playwright's auto-dismiss behavior and can hang the
page.

### Debug traces exclude user data

With `BROWSER_CONTROL_DEBUG=1`, `[bc:ctx]` logs contain bounded target,
ownership, context-lifecycle, loader, reset, and error-shape metadata. They do
not contain expressions, arguments, results, headers, cookies, or form values.

### Builds provide runtime identity

`scripts/build-cli.ts` injects the package version and build id. Source runs use
`0.0.0-dev` and a deterministic fingerprint of `src/*.ts`, `package.json`, and
`pnpm-lock.yaml`; runtime code does not hardcode release versions. The
relay reports both values so `doctor` can identify a stale long-running relay.
It also reports an instance id, start time, and PID; bounded managed-relay
process-fault diagnostics are retained locally so unexpected same-build
restarts can be distinguished from session eviction.
Explicit restart confirms the exact managed instance and safe shutdown protocol,
then waits for that process to exit before starting the current build. Ordinary
commands never replace a running relay.

## Known Limitations

- Browser Control does not expose custom `page.sessionId()`, `page.targetId()`,
  `frame.frameId()`, or `locator.selector()` APIs.
- Raw CDP behavior has no guarantees beyond stock Playwright and the relay's
  documented guardrails.
- Native `locator.fill()` can hang on login-style fields when installed browser
  extensions inject focus handlers or overlays. `fillInput` is the explicit
  fallback for input, textarea, and contenteditable elements.
- `fillInput` cannot reach fields inside closed shadow roots.
- OOPIF behavior is guaranteed only by the current reconnect smoke scenarios.
- Clipboard automation on insecure origins is not guaranteed.
- Playwright download events and `download.saveAs()` are unavailable in
  extension-backed tabs because Chromium blocks download behavior commands from
  `chrome.debugger`; download waits return a direct capability error.
- CDP recording activates its tab to avoid background compositor throttling,
   preserves the starting CSS viewport rather than downscaling to 720p, requires
   `ffmpeg` on `PATH`, and does not capture audio. It captures uncapped JPEG100
   compositor frames, normalizes device pixels using the first frame's surface
   width, then crops at native CSS size (rounding odd output dimensions down to
   even). Output defaults to 60 fps; actual motion depends on source frames.
   The encoder starts on the first frame; a start-time ffmpeg probe preserves
   missing-dependency errors. Keep viewport/emulation fixed during recording.
- Recording start/stop/status expose JSON receipts. CDP quality metrics come from
  the same counters as the sidecar: dimensions, configured rate, received/retained
  source frames and rates, coalescing/drops, and stop-time screenshot fallback.
  Compositor events are not distinct-motion measurements. Tab capture and older
  relays omit unavailable quality data. All explicit frame rates must be integers
  in 1..60; never silently clamp unsupported requests.
- The flight recorder has the same tab-activation, viewport, ffmpeg, and no-audio
  constraints as CDP recording. Its 128 MiB/7,200-frame bounds can shorten the
  requested retention window on visually busy pages.
- The trusted sandbox exposes selected Node built-ins, not unrestricted local
  command execution.
- Exact parity across third-party authentication remains a manual diagnostic.
  Compare the same starting URL and browser profile in a fresh relay-owned tab
  and an authenticated adopted tab without automating credentials, tokens, or
  production account state.

## Reliability

Canonical CDP clients can replay validated execution-context descriptions after
their frame-tree response and successful Runtime enable acknowledgment. Replay
is requester-scoped and deduplicated; target, frame, extension generation and
ownership changes invalidate it. Aliases and cache misses retain bounded reset
recovery. A cached observation alone is never proof of client readiness.

Adoption binds exact target identity independently of Playwright initialization.
The first execute resolves the adopted page lazily with a bounded native connect
timeout; failed setup retains ownership and never runs user code. Title-read
watchdogs report an operation-specific context-read timeout without triggering
page replacement or blocking cached URL reads. A timeout alone does not prove
renderer unresponsiveness.

`pnpm gauntlet:isolated` tests the current checkout through a disposable
Chromium profile, the real MV3 shim and a private relay without touching the
active runtime. Correctness failures are never retried into green. See
`docs/RELIABILITY.md` for CI lanes, evidence boundaries and next work.

Durable same-ID session lifecycle operations serialize publication and rollback;
an existing in-flight identity is not a durable acknowledgment. Credential
rotation preserves historical values for transient output redaction while secret
profiles retain only the current reference values. Handoff completion retains its
deadline and target-cancellation path until the start action settles.

## Backlog

These items are accepted directions but are not current priorities:

- Harden extension reconnect handling with `addEventListener`, one source for
  the `hello` message, and a bounded outbound event queue if lost debugger events
  continue to matter in practice.
- Add optional managed browser launch, including Brave and profile selection.
- Scope the saved human-shell current session by browser profile, in addition to
  relay endpoint, if multiple profiles become a supported workflow.
- Add stricter workspace or session ownership only if the loose shared attached
  tab pool causes concrete failures.
- Promote the reviewed Chrome Web Store extension from unlisted beta to public
  after one successful extension/relay compatibility cycle.
- Bundle an unpacked extension for managed and development browser launch.
- Add token-authenticated remote relay mode before allowing the relay to bind
  beyond loopback.
- Evaluate custom CDP or a smaller Playwright-compatible client only after stock
  Playwright creates a concrete blocker.
- Add richer compact snapshot semantics only in response to demonstrated agent
  failures.
- Add broader local execution behind an explicit capability only when an agent
  workflow requires it.
- Consider a right-click `send element to Browser Control` pin if handoff
  evidence shows a recurring element-selection problem.
- Add true mid-script cancellation. Toolbar clicks currently preserve active
  executes and handoffs rather than interrupting them.

Explicitly declined for now:

- Dedicated observation commands such as `browser-control snapshot`,
  `screenshot`, or `logs`; execute-level helpers are sufficient.
- Topic-specific `skill` subcommands; the workflow should remain one concise
  document.
- A side panel.

## Historical Milestone

The first milestone proved the complete path from toolbar attachment through the
extension and relay to stock Playwright. It also proved navigation,
`context.newPage()`, reconnect, OOPIF replay, dedicated workers, concurrent
session isolation, compact snapshots, handoffs, media returns, and local fixture
checkout flows.

The current smoke matrix covers local forms, cart and checkout, reconnect and
redirect reconnect, explicit target selection, crashed- and detached-page
recovery, fill helpers with string and Locator targets, snapshot refs, handoff
navigation and cross-tab binding, OOPIF reconnect, dedicated workers, the
download capability boundary, cursor behavior, session isolation,
multi-client visibility, stale-client ordering, and raw-client checkout.
Historical milestone scope is no longer used as the active backlog; `Next
Priorities` is authoritative.
